## My process 🏗️

### Built with 🛠️

- HTML
- CSS(native nesting)

### What I learned 🧠

I tried out a bit of nesting in _native_ css

```css
button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;

  /* hover state done using css nesting */
  &:hover {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
```
